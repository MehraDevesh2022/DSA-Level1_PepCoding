# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository :

This repository contains solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms problems in Java programming language. The solutions are arranged in the following topics:
- Basic Mathematics 
- Array
- ArrayList
- Basic Algorithm
- String
- StringBuilder
- 2D Array
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Heap and Queue
- Hashmap
- Stack and Queue
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Lambda Functions
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree
- Generic Tree
- Binary Tree
- Number System
- LinkedList
