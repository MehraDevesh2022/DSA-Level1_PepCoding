/*
Handle a Rejected Promise with catch
catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

myPromise.catch(error => {
  
});
error is the argument passed in to the reject method.

Add the catch method to your promise. Use error as the parameter of its callback function and log error to the console.

Tests
Passed:You should call the catch method on the promise.
Passed:Your catch method should have a callback function with error as its parameter.
Passed:You should log error to the console.
