/*
As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.

Tests
Passed:You should not replace the const keyword.
Passed:MATH_CONSTANTS should be a constant variable (by using const).
Passed:You should not change the original declaration of MATH_CONSTANTS.

function freezeObj() {

    // Only change code above this line

        MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
    } catch (ex) {
        console.log(ex);
