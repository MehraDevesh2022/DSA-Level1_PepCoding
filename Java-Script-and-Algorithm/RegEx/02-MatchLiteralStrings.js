/*
Match Literal Strings
In the last challenge, you searched for the word Hello using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string Hello. Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string Kevin:

let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
This test call will return true.

Any other forms of Kevin will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match kevin or KEVIN.

let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
This test call will return false.

A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.

Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.

Tests
Passed:Your regex waldoRegex should find the string Waldo
Passed:Your regex waldoRegex should not search for anything else.
Passed:You should perform a literal string match with your regex.

let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
