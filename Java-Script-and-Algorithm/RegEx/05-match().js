Extract Matches
So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the .match() method.

To use the .match() method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

Here's an example:

"Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
Here the first match would return ["Hello"] and the second would return ["expressions"].

Note that the .match syntax is the "opposite" of the .test method you have been using thus far:

'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
Apply the .match() method to extract the string coding.

Tests
Passed:The result should have the string coding
Passed:Your regex codingRegex should search for the string coding
Passed:You should use the .match() method.

let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; // Change this line
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex); // Change this line
