 * Easy Prev Next
 * 1. You are required to complete the code of our StackToQueueAdapter class.
 * The class should mimic the behaviour of a Queue and implement FIFO semantic.
 * 2. Here is the list of functions that are written in the class
 * 2.1. add -> Accepts new data if there is space available in the underlying
 * array or
 * print "Queue overflow" otherwise.
 * 2.2. remove -> Removes and returns value according to FIFO, if available or
 * print
