 /*
  * Power-linear
  * Easy Prev Next
  * 1. You are given a number x.
  * 2. You are given another number n.
  * 3. You are required to calculate x raised to the power n. Don't change the
  * signature of power function .
  * 
  * Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively
  * but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative
  * logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test
  * you.
  * Input Format
  * A number x
  * A number n
  * Output Format
  * x raised to the power n
