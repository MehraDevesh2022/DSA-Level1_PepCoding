Input Format

Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of  alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from  to .

Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly  characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

Sample Input

java 100
cpp 65
python 50
Sample Output

================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================
Explanation

Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first  characters. The leading digit of the integer is the  character, and each integer that was less than  digits now has leading zeroes.
