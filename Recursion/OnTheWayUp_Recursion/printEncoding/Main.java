/*
 * Print Encodings
 * Easy Prev Next
 * 1. You are given a string str of digits. (will never start with a 0)
 * 2. You are required to encode the str as per following rules
 * 1 -> a
 * 2 -> b
 * 3 -> c
 * ..
 * 25 -> y
 * 26 -> z
 * 3. Complete the body of printEncodings function - without changing signature
 * - to calculate and print all encodings of str.
 * Use the input-output below to get more understanding on what is required
 * 123 -> abc, aw, lc
 * 993 -> iic
 * 013 -> Invalid input. A string starting with 0 will not be passed.
 * 103 -> jc
 * 303 -> No output possible. But such a string maybe passed. In this case print
 * nothing.
 * 
 * Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively
 * but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative
 * logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test
 * you.
 * Input Format
 * A string str
 * Output Format
 * Permutations of str in order hinted by Sample output
 * Question Video

 * COMMENTConstraints
 * 0 <= str.length <= 10
 * Sample Input
 * 655196
