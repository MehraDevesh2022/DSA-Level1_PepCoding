 heap is tree loke data structure
 every heap is binray tree but not every binary tree are heap type. bcz heap is cbt type tree follows hop
 heap is  either min root type or max root compare to children node type just like pq
 heap always ==>
  cbt : complete binary tree
  hop : heap order priority (all roots either min or max type) 
   
   bcz of cbt behavior we have formula for heap to get parent node or left child or right child node
   formula : 
    lci = 2 * pIdx + 1 ( for geting left child idx)
    rci = 2 * pIdx + 2  ( for geting right child idx)
    pi  = cIdx - 1 /2  ( for geting parent child idx)

    pi ==> parent index
    lci ==> left child Idx
    rci ==> right child Idx
