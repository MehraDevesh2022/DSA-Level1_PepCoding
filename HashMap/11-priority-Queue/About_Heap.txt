 heap is tree like data structure
 every heap is binray tree but not every binary tree are heap type. bcz heap is cbt type tree follows hop
 heap is  either min  type or max type. all roots are min as compare to there children if heap is min type same for max type as well
 heap is follows  ==>
  cbt : complete binary tree
  hop : heap order priority (all roots either min or max type) 
   
   bcz of cbt behavior we have formula for heap to get parent node or left child or right child node
   formula : 
    lci = 2 * pIdx + 1 ( for geting left child idx)
    rci = 2 * pIdx + 2  ( for geting right child idx)
    pi  = cIdx - 1 /2  ( for geting parent child idx)

    pi ==> parent index
    lci ==> left child Idx
    rci ==> right child Idx
